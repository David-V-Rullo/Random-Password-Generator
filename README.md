# Random-Password-Generator

## Welcome

This is my first full javascript project. 

Based on user input it will randomly generate a string of 8 to 128 characters. 

These characters may be numbers, upper-case letters, lower-case letters, special characters, or any combination thereof. 

## How it works

The user will be prompted to select the following;
  *Number of characters
  *
